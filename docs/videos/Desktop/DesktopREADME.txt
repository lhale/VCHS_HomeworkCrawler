All Recordings done by Icecream-Screen-Recorder using my earbud 'headset' for audio shows various
walk-throughs of the 'flow' Powerpoint. All recordings done by Icecream-Screen-Recorder are
placed on the Desktop & are in WEBM format (can be converted to MP4 by Msoft Movie Maker or VideoPad). 

1) 
2)

flow.wmv - first recording attempt w/ lots of ahs... Uses a single PPT page and no pointers
flow_pg1_2.wmv - Uses a single PPT page and no pointers - very boring.
- 4thTryIceCreamRecorder.webm - Final recording of 6-screen walkthrough using many flow.ppt slides
- flow.mp4 - Final Movie Maker conversion from 4thTryIceCreamRecorder.webm. No edits.
- flow.wlmp - Icecream-Screen-Recorder project for flow.mp4
4thTryIceCreamRecorder.webm - FInal vid for describing the screen nav flow of the app screens. The 
finished vid is up @ C:\Larry\MeanGreenSoftware\Projects\FreshAlley\Docs\flow.mp4 (cvrt'd by MSoft Movie Maker)
All other First-Thirdtries are the sequential one-take trials (some have good stuff in them)


2) Fresh Alley App Internals Presentation
My Movie.wlmp - Intermediate video recording showing the internals (I think)
- FifthTryAppInternals.webm - Final app internals recording
- AppInternals.mp4 - Final Movie Maker conversion from FifthTryAppInternals.webm. 
Has a few edits as proof of concept for Movie Maker (not bad). 
Has a few ums & ahs, but generally presentable.
- AppInternals.wlmp - Icecream-Screen-Recorder project for AppInternals
FifthTryAppInternals.webm - Final vid for describing Fresh Alley droid app internals. The 
finished vid is up @ C:\Larry\MeanGreenSoftware\Projects\FreshAlley\Docs\AppInternals.mp4 (cvrt'd by MSoft Movie Maker)
All other First-Fourth tries are the sequential one-take trials (some have good stuff in them)
